The Game of SET
===============

A Python recreation of the card game SET.

===============

TO DO:

- Allow the game to automatically end when there
are no more valid sets to be made

- Allow multiplayer functionality (likely by
adding a step in gameflow to input which player
is guessing a set)

- Tracker to count how many sets each player has
acquired; to be displayed within status checker
and at end of game.
